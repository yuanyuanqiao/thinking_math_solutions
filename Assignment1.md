# Introductory material assignments' solutions
1.
* The woman with a telescope was seen by the man.
* The man with a telescope see the woman.

2.
* Sisters reunited in checkout line at Safeway, after ten years. (separation)

* Large hole appears in High Street. City authoritise are trying to fix it.
* Large hole appears in High Street. City authoritise are in process of fixing it.

* Mayor says bus passengers should wear bus' belts.
* Mayor says bus passengers should put on protection belts.

3. no head injury is too trivial to ignore

The background assumption is that some head injuries are too trivial, so they can be ignored. There is a threshold T that stays between the injuries that will be ignored/not ignored.
```
  Ignored           Not Ignored
------------- |T| ----------------
<- too trivial     less trivial ->
```

no head injury is too trivial to ignore. - This tells us that the threshold is so much on the right that no head injury is too trivial.
```
            Ignored
------------------------------- |T|
<- too trivial     less trivial ->
```

So based on that all head injuries can be ignored.


* Another helpful interpretation is:
"No X is too Y to be Z'd" can mean either "all Xs should be Z'd, no matter how Y" or "any X could be Z'd, no matter how Y.

4. in case of fire, do not use elevator

background assumption is that:
* in case of fire you should go out of the building.
* elevator is faster, more convenient and the general option for exiting.

The double meaning is that you can understand that:
* you can't put off fire with elevator

* clearer sentence would be:
```
in case of fire, do not use elevator as an exit.
in case of fire, use stairs to exit.
in case of fire, exit through the stairs.
```

5. this page intentionally left blank.

```
  it does not make true statement, because that text is on the page.

  possible purposes:
  - to separate of the publisher info and title and the content of the book
  - to show that the page does not contain any meaningful text
  - to leave space for the author to give a personalized note to the reader
  - to leave space for the reader for notes.
  - it gives you a break after you got tired, because of reading the title of the book and the publisher info

  alternatives:
  - This page is for content separation.
  - Page for your notes.
  - no book content on this page.

  from the wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentionally_blank_page
  - blank pages are result of printing conventions and techniques.
  - chapters often start on odd numbered page, so the blank page can be used to enable that.
  - some printer document processors has been designed to skip completely the blank pages, so that's why text is needed.
```

6.
* "no food or drink beyond this point" sing on coffeeshop where they sell drinks and food
* "god save the queen"
* "these pipe homes could fight rents" headline linking to this page http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20180301-homes-made-of-concrete-tubes-could-solve-the-housing-crisis

7. The temperature is hot today.
it says that the temperature can be hot/cold, instead of the implied meaning - the temperature is high, so the weather is hot.
```
temperature affects weather
high temperature -> hot weather
```

an equvalent of that sentence in math would be:

```
y = x*a + 1
larger the a -> the graph of y would be steeper

a is steeper in the function y.
```

8.
```
if (p1*p2*p3...*pn) is the list of all prime numbers then it means that the product can be divided only to one of those numbers.
When you add 1 to the product there are two options:
  1. the new value is some of the prime numbers in the list, which is not possible, because given n = a*b*c + 1  n > a & n > b & n > c
  2. the new value is not in the list -> so it's not prime
```
